# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


# Setting up the Development environment
Install [VS Code studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Install the following extensions in the VS Code: ES7 + React/Redux/React-Native snippets, Auto Rename Tag, Prettier-Code Formatter and Live Server.

Use [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for React Tooling. 
Then:
Check version of npm and node, npm --version and node --version respectfully. 
Otherwise download [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

cd the location you would like to put your project, either Desktop or Downloads or Documents,,, then run 'npm create vite@latest eastfacilities -- --template react'

Open the project in the VS Code. On the terminal run 'npm install' and run the code 'npm run dev' this will give you the local host server where to see your project as you make changes.

## Global Styles
- Less lines of Code for Styling in CSS under index.css in both assets and public folders
- These styles speed up development, avoid repeating code

## Title and Favicon
